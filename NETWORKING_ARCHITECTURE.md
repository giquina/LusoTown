# LusoTown Connections - Networking System Architecture

## Overview

LusoTown Connections is a comprehensive event-based networking system designed specifically for the Portuguese community in London. It automatically connects community members who attend the same events, fostering meaningful relationships within the Portuguese diaspora.

## System Philosophy

### Portuguese Cultural Values
- **"Saudade"**: Maintaining connections across distance and time
- **"Convívio"**: Celebrating togetherness and shared experiences
- **"Comunidade"**: Building strong community bonds
- **"Património"**: Preserving cultural heritage through connections

### Privacy-First Approach
- Connections are private to each user
- No public friend lists or social graphs
- User-controlled connection visibility
- Respect for Portuguese cultural privacy norms

## Core Architecture

### Event-Based Connection Model

The system creates connections based on shared event attendance rather than traditional social media friend requests:

```typescript
interface Connection {
  id: string
  userId: string
  connectedUserId: string
  connectedUser: UserProfile
  connectionSource: 'event_based' | 'mutual_friends' | 'manual'
  sharedEventsCount: number
  firstMetEventId?: string
  firstMetEvent?: EventDetails
  connectionStrength: number
  lastInteractionAt: string
  isActive: boolean
  privacyLevel: 'public' | 'normal' | 'private'
  createdAt: string
}
```

### Connection Strength Algorithm

Connection strength is calculated based on:
1. **Shared Events**: Number of events attended together
2. **Event Types**: Cultural events weighted higher
3. **Interaction Frequency**: Recent interactions boost strength
4. **Event Duration**: Longer events create stronger connections
5. **Portuguese Context**: Cultural events receive bonus weighting

```typescript
function calculateConnectionStrength(connection: Connection): number {
  const baseStrength = connection.sharedEventsCount * 10
  const culturalBonus = connection.culturalEventsAttended * 5
  const recentBonus = isRecentInteraction(connection.lastInteractionAt) ? 10 : 0
  const timeDecay = calculateTimeDecay(connection.createdAt)
  
  return Math.min(100, baseStrength + culturalBonus + recentBonus - timeDecay)
}
```
