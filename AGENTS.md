---

## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Agents

### ⚡ 30-Second Setup
```bash
# 1. Start development (parallel terminals)
cd web-app && npm install && npm run dev    # http://localhost:3001
cd streaming && npm install && npm start    # http://localhost:8080

# 2. Essential environment setup
cp web-app/.env.local.example web-app/.env.local  # Configure Supabase keys

# 3. Test demo access
# Login: demo@lusotown.com / LusoTown2025!
```

### 🔥 Critical Pre-Commit Checks
```bash
cd web-app
npm run lint                 # ❌ Must pass - ESLint validation
npx tsc --noEmit            # ❌ Must pass - TypeScript check
npm run build               # ❌ Must pass - Production build
npm run audit:hardcoding    # ❌ Must pass - Zero hardcoded values
npm run test:all            # ✅ Optional - Full test suite
```

---

## 🎯 Core Principles for AI Agents

### 1. 🚨 ZERO HARDCODING POLICY (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS:
const price = "£19.99"
const contact = "demo@lusotown.com"
const university = "University College London"

// ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS:
import { formatPrice, SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS } from '@/config/pricing'
import { UNIVERSITY_PARTNERSHIPS } from '@/config/universities'
const price = formatPrice(SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.community.monthly)
```

**❌ INSTANT REJECTION:** Any hardcoded values will break the build and fail audits.  
**✅ ALWAYS:** Import from `/src/config/` - prices, contacts, URLs, cultural data, university info.

### 2. 🌍 BILINGUAL-FIRST DEVELOPMENT (MANDATORY)
```typescript
// ❌ NEVER hardcode text:
<h1>Welcome to LusoTown</h1>

// ✅ ALWAYS use translations:
const { t } = useLanguage()
<h1>{t('welcome.title')}</h1>
```

### 3. 🇵🇹 PORTUGUESE CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Use Portuguese brand colors from `@/config/brand.ts`
- No generic blue/gray colors
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Cultural elements integrated, not separate

### 4. ⚙️ CONFIGURATION-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE (REQUIRED)
All dynamic data lives in `/src/config/`:
- `pricing.ts` - All pricing, subscriptions, discounts
- `universities.ts` - University partnerships, student counts  
- `cultural-centers.ts` - Portuguese cultural institutions
- `routes.ts` - All URL routing
- `brand.ts` - Brand colors, styling
- `contact.ts` - Contact information

└── utils/                  # Helper functions
```

### Essential Files for Agents
- **Config Files**: `/src/config/*` - Import all data from here
- **Translations**: `/src/i18n/{en.json, pt.json}` - All user-facing text
- **Contexts**: `/src/context/*` - State management providers
- **Types**: Look for TypeScript interfaces in relevant files

---

## 🛠️ Agent-Specific Guidelines

### Code Generation Rules
1. **Import First**: Always check existing imports and config files
2. **Type Safety**: Use proper TypeScript interfaces
3. **Mobile-First**: Design for 375px mobile, scale up
4. **Portuguese Context**: Integrate cultural elements naturally
5. **Test Coverage**: Include test files for significant components

### Common Patterns to Follow
```typescript
// Pricing
import { formatPrice, getFormattedPlanPrice } from '@/config/pricing'

// Translations
const { t, language } = useLanguage()

// Portuguese brand colors
className="bg-primary-600 text-white" // Not bg-blue-600

// Routes
import { ROUTES } from '@/config/routes'
href={ROUTES.events} // Not "/events"
```

### Files You Should Never Edit
- `/src/config/*` files contain environment-configurable data
- `/src/i18n/*` translation files (unless adding new keys)
- Build outputs in `.next/`, `dist/`

---

## 🔍 Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Errors**: Check TypeScript imports and config file paths
2. **Missing Translations**: Add keys to both `en.json` and `pt.json`
3. **Hardcoded Values**: Run `npm run audit:hardcoding`
4. **State Issues**: Verify Context providers in `app/layout.tsx`
5. **Mobile Issues**: Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px breakpoints

### Debugging Checklist
- [ ] Console errors in browser dev tools
- [ ] Network tab for API call failures
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Portuguese cultural elements present (not generic)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design working

---

## ⚡ RAPID DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS

### 🛠️ Quick Component Creation
```typescript
// 1. Always start with this template:
import { useLanguage } from '@/context/LanguageContext'
import { formatPrice } from '@/config/pricing'
import { ROUTES } from '@/config/routes'

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { t, language } = useLanguage()
  
  return (
    <div className="bg-primary-50 text-primary-900"> {/* Portuguese colors */}
      <h1>{t('component.title')}</h1> {/* Never hardcode text */}
      <p>{formatPrice(29.99)}</p> {/* Never hardcode prices */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 📊 Data Fetching Pattern
```typescript
// Always use this pattern for data:
import { UNIVERSITY_PARTNERSHIPS } from '@/config/universities'
import { CULTURAL_CENTERS } from '@/config/cultural-centers'

// Not hardcoded arrays - always from config!
const universities = UNIVERSITY_PARTNERSHIPS.filter(uni => uni.region === 'london')
```

### 🎨 Styling Guidelines
```typescript
// ✅ USE: Portuguese brand colors
className="bg-primary-600 text-white hover:bg-primary-700"
className="border-secondary-300 text-secondary-600"

// ❌ NEVER: Generic Tailwind colors  
className="bg-blue-600"    // ❌ Wrong!
className="bg-gray-500"    // ❌ Wrong!
```

## 🎨 CRITICAL UI/UX RULES & STANDARDS

### 🚨 **BUTTON & CTA REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)**

#### Button Text Rules
- **ALL CTA button text MUST be displayed in a single line**
- **NEVER allow button text to wrap to multiple lines**
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Book Together" (single line)
  - ✅ "Start Streaming" (single line)  
  - ✅ "View Packages" (single line)
  - ❌ "Book" on first line, "Together" on second line

#### CSS Implementation (Apply to ALL CTA buttons)
```css
.cta-button {
  white-space: nowrap;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  overflow: hidden;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .cta-button {
    font-size: 0.875rem;
    padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;
    min-width: fit-content;
  }
}
```

### 🗺️ **GEOGRAPHIC TERMINOLOGY RULES (STRICT)**

#### Location References
- **NEVER use "London" when referring to the broader community**
- **ALWAYS use "United Kingdom" or "UK" for community-wide references**
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Connect with Portuguese speakers in the United Kingdom"
  - ✅ "Portuguese community in the UK"
  - ❌ "Portuguese community in London"
  - ❌ "Connect with Portuguese speakers in London"

#### Specific Location Usage
- Only use "London" when referring to specific London-based events, venues, or services
- For general community features, matches, or platform descriptions, use "United Kingdom"

### 📱 **MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS RULES (CRITICAL)**

#### Card Layouts
- **ALL card content must stay within card boundaries**
- **NO content should overflow outside card containers**
- **Test all cards at 375px, 768px, and 1024px breakpoints**

#### Modal Sizing
- Mobile modals: `max-h-[85vh]` 
- Desktop modals: `max-w-[3xl]`
- Always implement click-outside-to-close functionality

#### Navigation Dropdowns
- Center dropdowns using: `left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2`
- Add margin calculations to prevent viewport overflow
- Use: `marginLeft: 'max(-340px, calc(-50vw + 1rem))'`

### 🎯 **CONTENT & MESSAGING RULES**

#### Streaming Services
- **NEVER use complex phrases like "Put your be streaming in London"**
- **Use simple, clear labels: "Streaming"**
- **Remove unnecessary words and keep it concise**

#### Profile Information
- **Remove location text that overlays compatibility scores**
- **Use flags only for origin indicators when space is limited**
- **Ensure compatibility badges are clearly visible**

### 🎨 **VISUAL HIERARCHY RULES**

#### Badge Positioning
- Compatibility badges: top-right corner
- Origin flags: top-left corner (flag only, no text on mobile)
- Verification badges: secondary position to avoid overlap

#### Text Overflow
- All truncated text must use: `truncate max-w-[appropriate-size]`
- Ensure important information (like match percentages) is never hidden
- Priority: Match percentage > User actions > Secondary info

### 📋 **PRE-COMMIT UI/UX CHECKLIST**

Before committing any UI changes, verify:
- [ ] All CTA buttons display text in single line
- [ ] No "London" references in community-wide contexts
- [ ] All cards contain content within boundaries  
- [ ] Mobile modals use correct max-height/width
- [ ] Navigation dropdowns are properly centered
- [ ] Portuguese cultural colors are used (not generic blue/gray)
- [ ] Bilingual functionality works in both EN/PT
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tested at 375px, 768px, 1024px
