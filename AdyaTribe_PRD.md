## 1. Executive Summary & Goals

### Mission Statement
AdyaTribe creates authentic, safety-first communities for women 30+ who are single and childfree, enabling meaningful connections through shared interests and local experiences rather than superficial matching.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Safety-First Community:** AI-powered selfie verification and women-only spaces with active moderation
- **Group-Centric Design:** Focus on interest-based groups and events, not 1:1 matching/dating features
- **Authentic Connections:** Real identity verification eliminates fake profiles and catfishing
- **Local + Digital Hybrid:** London-focused initially, with UK expansion planned
- **Membership-Driven:** Sustainable revenue through tiered subscriptions, not ads or data sales

### Primary Business Objectives
1. **Launch MVP:** Complete membership platform with 500+ verified users by Q4 2025
2. **Community Health:** Achieve 70%+ monthly active user rate and 4.5+ app store rating
3. **Revenue Target:** Â£50K ARR through subscription tiers by end of Year 1
4. **Safety Standards:** Maintain 95%+ user verification rate and sub-1% reported incidents
5. **Market Position:** Become the leading platform for 30+ single childfree women in London

### Competitive Differentiation
- **Explicit Niche Focus:** Only platform specifically for 30+ single childfree women
- **No Dating Features:** Pure friendship/community focus (unlike Bumble BFF's dating overlap)
- **Age-Verified Safe Spaces:** Prevents younger users diluting the 30+ experience
- **UK Cultural Integration:** London-specific interests, events, and cultural understanding
- **Membership Model:** Quality over quantity through paid tiers (vs ad-supported competitors)
