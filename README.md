### **Troubleshooting New Features**

**Business Directory Map Issues:**
- **Map not loading**: Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_SERVICE=openstreetmap` in `.env.local`
- **Markers not showing**: Check if PostGIS extension is enabled in Supabase
- **Distance calculation errors**: Ensure coordinates are valid latitude/longitude values

**Geolocation Issues:**
- **"Near Me" not working**: Requires HTTPS in production, HTTP allowed in development
- **Location permission denied**: Browser will remember user's choice, clear site data to reset
- **Fallback locations**: Portuguese areas (Vauxhall, Stockwell) used when geolocation unavailable

**Twitter Feed Issues:**
- **Feed not loading**: Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN` configuration
- **Hashtags not displaying**: Verify Portuguese hashtags are properly configured
- **Rate limiting**: Twitter API has request limits, implement proper caching

**Business Submission Issues:**
- **Form validation errors**: Check all required fields are properly filled
- **Photo upload failing**: Verify file types and size limits in environment variables
- **Submission not saving**: Ensure database migration for business submissions is applied

**UI/UX Issues:**
- **Welcome modal too large**: Ensure responsive sizing with `max-h-[85vh]` (mobile) and `max-w-[3xl]` (desktop)
- **Navigation dropdowns misaligned**: Use `left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2` for proper centering
- **Modal not closing on backdrop click**: Verify click-outside-to-close handlers are implemented
