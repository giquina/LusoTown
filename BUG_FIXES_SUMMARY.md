# LusoTown Bug Fixes Summary
*Fixed: August 14, 2025*
*Status: ✅ COMPLETED - All Issues Resolved*

## Issues Fixed

### 🐛 Issue 1: Infinite Loading on Event Detail Pages
**Problem**: When users clicked "View Event" from /events page, individual event detail pages showed "Loading event details..." indefinitely.

**Root Cause**: The `getEventById` function in `/lib/events.ts` was trying to connect to Supabase but failing in demo mode, returning `null` instead of falling back to mock data.

**Solution Implemented**: ✅
- Updated `getEventById` function to check Supabase configuration
- Added fallback to mock data when Supabase is not configured
- Enhanced error handling with multiple fallback layers
- Exported missing Supabase constants (`supabaseUrl`, `supabaseAnonKey`)

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspaces/LusoTown/web-app/src/lib/events.ts`
- `/workspaces/LusoTown/web-app/src/lib/supabase.ts`

**Result**: Users can now click on events from /events page and see full event details immediately without loading issues.

### 🎨 Issue 2: WhatsApp Widget Text Changes
**Problem**: WhatsApp widget on right-hand side showed "Welcome to LusoTown" and "Hello" text that user wanted removed.

**Solution Implemented**: ✅
- Removed "Welcome to LusoTown" text completely
- Removed "Hello! 👋" paragraph entirely
- Changed all welcome text to simply "Click to start" in both English and Portuguese
- Maintained functionality while simplifying the message

**Files Modified**:
- `/workspaces/LusoTown/web-app/src/components/WhatsAppWidget.tsx`

**Result**: Widget now shows clean "Click to start" message instead of verbose welcome text.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Detail Page Fix
```typescript
// Before (causing infinite loading)
if (error || !event) {
  console.error('Error fetching event:', error)
  return null // ❌ Returns null, causing infinite loading
}

// After (with fallback)
if (supabaseUrl !== 'https://placeholder.supabase.co' && supabaseAnonKey !== 'placeholder-key') {
  // Try Supabase first if configured
  // ... Supabase logic
}

// Fallback to mock data when Supabase is not available
console.log('Supabase not configured, using mock data for event:', id)
const mockEvent = this.events.find(e => e.id === id)

if (mockEvent) {
  return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mockEvent)) // ✅ Returns mock data
}
```

### WhatsApp Widget Changes
```tsx
// Before
{isPortuguese ? 'Bem-vindo à LusoTown!' : 'Welcome to LusoTown!'}

// After
{isPortuguese ? 'Clica para começar' : 'Click to start'}

// Removed entirely
<p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-sm">
  {isPortuguese ? 'Olá! 👋' : 'Hello! 👋'}
</p>
```
