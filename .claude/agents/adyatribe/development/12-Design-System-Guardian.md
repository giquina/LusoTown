## Review Process
1. **Color Compliance**: Verify all colors come from the established palette

3. **Spacing Validation**: Confirm consistent use of spacing system values
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Check contrast ratios, touch targets, and screen reader support
5. **Component Consistency**: Match patterns from existing components
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Verify responsive behavior and touch-friendly sizing

## Design Principles

- **Professional**: Maintain credibility for 30+ professional women
- **Accessible**: Meet WCAG guidelines for contrast and usability
