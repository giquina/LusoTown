# Claude Code Hooks Documentation

This directory contains Claude Code hooks that enhance the development workflow for the LusoTown project.

## Auto-Todo List Hook

**File**: `hooks/user-prompt-submit.sh`

### Purpose
Automatically detects complex tasks and suggests creating todo lists to maintain tracking and organization throughout development work.

### Features

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Complex Task Detection**
Analyzes user prompts for keywords indicating multi-step work:
- Implementation keywords: `implement`, `create`, `build`, `develop`, `update`, `fix`, `refactor`
- Scope keywords: `multiple`, `several`, `various`, `and`, `also`, `then`, `after`
- Technical keywords: `deploy`, `setup`, `configure`, `integrate`, `optimize`, `redesign`

When 2+ keywords are detected, the hook suggests creating a comprehensive todo list.

#### ðŸš€ **Deployment Reminders**
When deployment-related keywords are detected (`deploy`, `push`, `commit`, `github`, `git`), provides reminders for:
- Running tests before deployment
- Creating detailed commit messages
- Updating documentation

#### ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ **LusoTown-Specific Guidance**
When Portuguese/community-related work is detected, provides context-specific reminders:
- Ensure Portuguese cultural authenticity
- Consider age restrictions and women-only events
- Use Portuguese theme colors (green â†’ red â†’ yellow)
- Test events page and homepage showcase

### Usage Examples
