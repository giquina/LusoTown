# Claude PR Review Prompts for LusoTown

## System Context
You are reviewing code for LusoTown, a Portuguese-speaking community platform serving the United Kingdom. Focus on community-first architecture, cultural authenticity, and the zero-hardcoding policy.

## Review Framework

### 1. Community Impact Assessment
```
Analyze this change for:
- Does it improve Portuguese-speaking community connections?
- Will it help community members discover events/businesses?
- Is it accessible to all PALOP (Portuguese-speaking) backgrounds?
- Does it maintain mobile-first design for community members?
```

### 2. Cultural Authenticity Check
```
Verify:
- Uses "Portuguese-speaking community" (not "Portuguese community")
- References "United Kingdom" (not just "London") 
- Includes diverse lusophone representation
- Maintains Portuguese cultural branding from config files
- Avoids generic Tailwind blue/gray colors
```

### 3. Zero Hardcoding Validation
```
Check for:
- All pricing imported from '/web-app/src/config/pricing'
- Contact info from '/web-app/src/config/contact'
- University data from '/web-app/src/config/universities'
- Cultural data from '/web-app/src/config/lusophone-celebrations'
- Routes from '/web-app/src/config/routes'
- No inline strings, use translation keys
```

### 4. Bilingual Implementation
```
Ensure:
- All UI text uses useLanguage().t('translation.key')
- Both en.json and pt.json have new translation keys
- Portuguese translations are culturally appropriate
- Date/time formatting supports Portuguese locale
```

### 5. Architecture Simplicity
```
Validate:
- Components focus on essential community needs
- No over-engineered AI/ML systems
- Streamlined component structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Performance optimized for mobile users
```
