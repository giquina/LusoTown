**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Critical Issues Found:** 8  
**High Priority Issues:** 12  
**Medium Priority Issues:** 7  
**Low Priority Issues:** 3  

**Total Hardcoding Violations:** 130,122 across 675 files

---

## 1. Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities

### 1.1 CRITICAL: Exposed Production Tokens
**Severity: CRITICAL**  
**Files:** `/workspaces/LusoTown/.env.production.local`

**Issue:** Active Vercel OIDC token exposed in version control
```
VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6Im1yay00MzAyZWMxYjY3MGY0OGE5OGFkNjFkYWRlNGEyM2JlNyJ9..."
```

**Risk:** Complete platform compromise, unauthorized deployment access, data breach potential

**Immediate Action Required:** Revoke token, remove from repository, update .gitignore

### 1.2 CRITICAL: Hardcoded Demo Credentials
**Severity: CRITICAL**  
**Files:** Multiple locations including API routes

**Issue:** Demo credentials referenced throughout codebase
- Email: `demo@lusotown.com` 
- Password patterns detectable in security audit

**Risk:** Unauthorized access to demo accounts, credential stuffing attacks

### 1.3 HIGH: Missing Authentication Middleware
**Severity: HIGH**

**Issue:** No global middleware for authentication validation
- No rate limiting at middleware level
- No session validation middleware
- API routes handle auth individually (inconsistent patterns)

**Risk:** Inconsistent security enforcement, potential bypass vulnerabilities

### 1.4 HIGH: Weak Admin Role Validation
**Severity: HIGH**  
**File:** `/src/lib/auth.ts`

**Issue:** Admin role based on email domain check only
```typescript
role: isAdminEmail(profile.email) ? "admin" : "user"
```

**Risk:** Email spoofing could lead to privilege escalation

---

## 2. Data Protection and GDPR Compliance

```typescript
const locationFilter = filters.location.map(loc => `location.ilike.%${loc}%`).join(',')
query = query.or(locationFilter)
```

**Risk:** Database compromise, data exfiltration

### 3.2 HIGH: Insufficient Input Validation
**Severity: HIGH**  
**Files:** Multiple API routes

**Issues:**
- Message content validation limited to length only
