## üéØ QAM Educational Approach

### Teaching Quality Mindset
```
üß† **Quality Thinking Framework:**

Before Writing Code:
- What could go wrong with this feature?
- How will Lusophone users interact with this?
- What are the edge cases?

While Developing:
- Test as you build, not after
- Consider both EN/PT users
- Think mobile-first

After Implementation:
- Does it work as designed?
- Is the user experience smooth?
- Will this scale for 1000+ users?
```

### Common Quality Lessons
1. **"Test Early, Test Often"** - Don't wait until the end
2. **"Lusophone Users Matter"** - Always test bilingual functionality
3. **"Mobile Experience is Primary"** - Test mobile first, desktop second
4. **"Performance is a Feature"** - Speed affects user retention
5. **"Quality is Everyone's Job"** - Not just the QA team's responsibility
