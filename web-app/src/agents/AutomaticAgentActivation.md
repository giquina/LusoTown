# Automatic Agent Activation System

## Overview
This system enables AI assistants to **automatically trigger specialized agents** based on context, errors, and user needs without requiring manual agent calls.

## Auto-Activation Rules

### 1. Development Troubleshooting Agent
**Auto-triggers when**:
- Error messages containing: `Cannot find module`, `ENOTEMPTY`, `Port 3000 is in use`

## Implementation Strategy

### Context-Based Activation
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for automatic agent activation
class AutomaticAgentSystem {
  analyzeUserInput(input: string, context: Context) {
    // Scan for trigger patterns
    const triggers = this.identifyTriggers(input, context);
    
    // Auto-activate relevant agents
    triggers.forEach(trigger => {
      this.activateAgent(trigger.agentType, {
        context,
        urgency: trigger.urgency,
        autoMode: true
      });
    });
  }

  identifyTriggers(input: string, context: Context) {
    const triggers = [];
    
    // Development issues
    if (this.matchesPattern(input, DEVELOPMENT_ERROR_PATTERNS)) {
      triggers.push({
        agentType: 'development-troubleshooting-advisor',
        urgency: 'high',
        reason: 'Development error detected'
      });
    }
    
    // Inclusivity checks
    if (this.matchesPattern(input, COMMUNITY_CONTENT_PATTERNS)) {
      triggers.push({
        agentType: 'instruction-compliance-advisor',
        urgency: 'medium', 
        reason: 'Community content requires inclusivity validation'
      });
    }
    
    // Performance concerns
    if (this.matchesPattern(input, PERFORMANCE_PATTERNS)) {
      triggers.push({
        agentType: 'performance-coach-advisor',
        urgency: 'medium',
        reason: 'Performance optimization opportunity'
      });
    }
    
    return triggers;
  }
}
```

### Error Pattern Detection
```javascript
const TRIGGER_PATTERNS = {
  developmentErrors: [
    /Cannot find module/i,
    /ENOTEMPTY/i,
    /Port \d+ is in use/i,
    /build.*(fail|error)/i,
    /npm.*(error|ERR!)/i,
    /webpack.*error/i,
    /TypeScript.*error/i
  ],
  
  communityContent: [
    /Portuguese community/i,
    /London.*Portuguese/i,
    /event.*Portuguese/i,
    /community.*guidelines/i,
    /cultural.*content/i
  ],
  
  performanceIssues: [
    /slow.*loading/i,
    /performance.*issue/i,
    /mobile.*problem/i,
    /site.*slow/i,
    /optimization/i
  ],
  
  securityConcerns: [
    /security.*issue/i,
    /privacy.*concern/i,
    /GDPR/i,
    /authentication.*problem/i,
    /data.*protection/i
  ],
  
  strategicDecisions: [
    /should we.*prioritize/i,
    /business.*strategy/i,
    /feature.*planning/i,
    /resource.*allocation/i,
    /roadmap/i
  ]
};
```

## Agent Activation Flow

### 1. Immediate Response Pattern
```
User Input: "The website won't load, getting TailwindCSS errors"

Auto-Response:
üõ†Ô∏è **Development Troubleshooting Agent Activated**

I've detected a TailwindCSS module resolution error. Let me diagnose and fix this:

**Issue Identified**: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss' in monorepo structure
**Solution**: Installing TailwindCSS in correct location...

```

### 2. Multi-Agent Activation
```
User Input: "Let's create events for the Portuguese community in London"

Auto-Response:
üìã **Multiple Agents Activated**

üåç **Instruction Compliance Advisor**: Detected community content requiring inclusivity validation
- ‚úÖ Correcting: "Portuguese community" ‚Üí "Portuguese-speaking community"
