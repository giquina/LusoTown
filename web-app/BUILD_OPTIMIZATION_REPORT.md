## =€ Deployment System Enhancements

### Advanced Monitoring Dashboard
```bash
# Health Check Commands
npm run build:monitor          # Build with monitoring
node scripts/deployment-monitor.js --monitor  # Continuous monitoring
node scripts/deployment-monitor.js           # Single health check
```

### Performance Metrics Tracked
- **Deployment Health**: Response time, status codes, performance
- **Build Health**: Component compilation, warnings, errors
- **Community Features**: Portuguese cultural components, PALOP representation
- **Performance**: Memory usage, build times, system resources

### Alert System Configuration
| Alert Type | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Performance** | Health score <70 | Medium severity alert |
| **Critical** | Build failure | High severity alert + recommendations |
| **Degradation** | 3+ declining checks | Trend analysis alert |

## <¯ Build Pipeline Quality Gates

### Pre-deployment Validation
```bash
# Complete validation pipeline
npm run qa:pre-deploy     # Full quality check
npm run audit:hardcoding  # Configuration compliance
npm run lint              # Code quality
npx tsc --noEmit         # TypeScript validation
npm run build:optimized   # Production build test
```

### Success Criteria
-  Build time under 8 minutes
-  Zero missing component errors
-  Health score above 70/100
-  Memory usage under allocated threshold
-  All Portuguese community features operational

## =Ê System Resource Utilization

### Memory Management
- **Adaptive Allocation**: Based on available system memory
- **Garbage Collection**: Forced cleanup during build process
- **Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking
- **Thresholds**: 85% memory usage triggers optimization

### CPU Optimization
- **Thread Pool**: Reduced to 1/3 of available cores for stability
- **Worker Processes**: Limited to 1 for memory efficiency
- **Build Parallelism**: Controlled to prevent resource exhaustion

## =à Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Build Issues & Solutions

#### Missing Component Errors
**Symptoms**: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/...`
**Solution**: 
1. Check component exists in filesystem
2. Verify export in `/src/components/index.ts`
3. Create missing component with Portuguese community focus

#### Memory Allocation Errors
**Symptoms**: `JavaScript heap out of memory`
**Solution**:
```bash
npm run build:memory-safe  # Use memory-constrained build
# Or adjust memory allocation in chunked-build.js
```

#### TypeScript Compilation Issues
**Symptoms**: Type errors blocking build
**Solution**:
```bash
# Temporarily skip type checking
SKIP_TYPE_CHECK=true npm run build:fast
# Or fix types incrementally
npm run type-check
```

### Emergency Build Procedures
```bash
# Emergency build bypass
npm run build:fast           # Skip type checking
npm run build:standard       # Direct Next.js build
npm run build:memory-safe    # Constrained environment build
```
