### Promote-only Production (Vercel)

We deploy Production via Vercel “Promote” to avoid rebuild flakes and keep releases reliable:

- Push to `main` → Vercel creates a Preview build.
- Once Preview is READY, promote it to Production (no rebuild).
- Auto Production builds from `main` are skipped via `vercel.json`.

Automation

- GitHub Action: `.github/workflows/promote-on-green.yml`
  - Waits for a READY Preview matching the commit (or branch)
  - Calls Vercel’s Promote API to update Production

Required GitHub Secrets

- `VERCEL_TOKEN` (from the ilyjiquina… Vercel account)
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- `VERCEL_TEAM_ID` (optional if using a Team)

Verify the setup

1. Push a commit to `main`.
2. In GitHub → Actions → “Promote Preview to Production (Vercel)”, open the latest run:
   - Step “Validate env” prints “Env OK” if secrets are present
   - Step “Wait for Preview build to be READY” finds the Preview
   - Step “Promote to Production” requests promotion (no rebuild)

Manual Promote (UI)

- In Vercel, open any READY Preview and click “Promote to Production”. This is instant and uses the reliable artifact.
