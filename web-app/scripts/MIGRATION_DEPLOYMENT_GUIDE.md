# LusoTown Streaming Platform Migration Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for applying the streaming platform database migration (`20250818_001_streaming_platform_schema.sql`) to your Supabase database. This migration creates the complete streaming infrastructure for the Portuguese-speaking community platform.

## What the Migration Includes

### Core Infrastructure
- **Stream Categories**: Portuguese-focused content categories with bilingual support
- **Streams Table**: Complete streaming infrastructure with cultural context
- **Viewer Sessions**: Advanced analytics and engagement tracking
- **Stream Auth Tokens**: JWT-based authentication for streaming endpoints

### Portuguese Cultural Features
- **Portuguese Emotes System**: Cultural emotes (`:saudade:`, `:festa:`, `:futebol:`)
- **Cultural Regions**: Support for Brazil, Portugal, Africa, Diaspora contexts
- **Language Support**: Portuguese/English bilingual streaming categories

### User Management
- **User Streaming Settings**: Permissions, rate limiting, quality settings
- **Stream Reports**: Content moderation and community safety
- **Monetization Settings**: Creator economy and revenue sharing

### Storage and Security
- **Storage Buckets**: `stream-thumbnails`, `stream-recordings`, `portuguese-emotes`
- **Row Level Security**: Comprehensive RLS policies for all tables
- **Functions and Triggers**: Automated stream key generation, metrics tracking

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Project**: Active Supabase project with database access
2. **Environment Variables**: Properly configured Supabase credentials
3. **Permissions**: Database admin or service role permissions
4. **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher for running the migration script

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Required for migration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Alternative: Use anon key (less secure)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Getting Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your LusoTown project
3. Navigate to **Settings** > **API**
4. Copy the **Project URL** and **Service Role Key**

## Migration Methods

### Method 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

The safest and most reliable method using our custom migration script:

```bash
# Navigate to web-app directory
cd web-app

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Run the streaming platform migration
npm run db:migrate:streaming
```

#### Expected Output

```
<ï¿½ LusoTown Streaming Platform Migration Script
================================================
= Connecting to Supabase...

<ï¿½ SUCCESS! Streaming platform migration applied successfully!
```

### Method 2: Manual SQL Application

If you prefer to apply the migration manually:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Go to your Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor**

2. **Copy Migration Content**:
   - Open `/supabase/migrations/20250818_001_streaming_platform_schema.sql`
   - Copy the entire file content

3. **Execute in Chunks**:
   - Paste and run the migration in smaller chunks to avoid timeouts
   - Start with table creation statements
   - Then apply indexes and policies
   - Finally, insert seed data

## Post-Migration Verification

### 1. Check Table Creation

Run these queries in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Verify core tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('streams', 'stream_categories', 'viewer_sessions', 'portuguese_emotes', 'user_streaming_settings');

-- Check row counts for seed data
SELECT 'stream_categories' as table_name, count(*) as rows FROM stream_categories
UNION ALL
SELECT 'portuguese_emotes' as table_name, count(*) as rows FROM portuguese_emotes;
```

Expected results:
- 5 core streaming tables created
- 10 stream categories with Portuguese cultural context
- 10 Portuguese emotes with regional support

### 2. Verify Storage Buckets

Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard and confirm these buckets exist:
- `stream-thumbnails` (public)
- `stream-recordings` (private)
- `portuguese-emotes` (public)

### 3. Test RLS Policies

```sql
-- Test that policies are working
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename LIKE '%stream%';
```

Should return multiple RLS policies for streaming tables.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Errors
```
Error: Missing Supabase configuration
```
**Solution**: Verify your `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials.

#### 2. Permission Denied
```
Error: insufficient privileges
```
**Solution**: Ensure you're using the service role key, not the anon key.

#### 3. Migration Already Applied
```
ï¿½ Migration already applied. Skipping...
```
**Result**: This is normal if the migration was already run successfully.

#### 4. Timeout Errors
```
Error: Request timeout
```
**Solution**: The script automatically chunks large migrations. If still failing, try applying the migration manually in smaller pieces.

### Manual Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback the migration:

```sql
-- WARNING: This will delete all streaming data
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS viewer_sessions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stream_auth_tokens CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stream_reports CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_streaming_settings CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS streams CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stream_categories CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS portuguese_emotes CASCADE;

-- Remove storage buckets (do this manually in Supabase dashboard)
-- Delete: stream-thumbnails, stream-recordings, portuguese-emotes
```

## Next Steps After Migration

### 1. Configure Streaming Infrastructure
- Set up SRS (Simple Relay Server) for RTMP streaming
- Configure CDN endpoints for Portuguese-speaking community content
- Set up SSL certificates for streaming domains

### 2. Test Portuguese Features
- Verify Portuguese emotes display correctly
- Test stream categories filtering by cultural context
- Confirm bilingual content displays properly

### 3. Set Up Creator Monetization
- Configure payment processing for creator revenue
- Set up subscription tiers for premium streaming
- Test revenue sharing calculations (70/30 ï¿½ 85/15 for Portuguese creators)

### 4. Enable Content Moderation
- Configure Portuguese language toxicity detection
- Set up moderation workflows for cultural sensitivity
- Test reporting system for inappropriate content

### 5. Deploy Frontend Components
- Update streaming components to use new database schema
- Test real-time chat with Portuguese emotes
- Verify creator dashboard functionality
