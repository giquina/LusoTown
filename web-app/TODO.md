#### **Restoring Homepage Carousels (If Needed)**
1. **Import Carousel System**:
   ```tsx
   import { LusophoneCarousel } from '@/components/carousels'
   ```

2. **Add Cultural Data Source**:
   ```tsx
   import { LUSOPHONE_CELEBRATIONS } from '@/config/lusophone-celebrations'
   ```

3. **Insert Carousel Section**:
   ```tsx
   <section className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
     <LusophoneCarousel
       items={LUSOPHONE_CELEBRATIONS.slice(0, 6)}
       title={{
         en: "Portuguese Community Highlights",
         pt: "Destaques da Comunidade Portuguesa"
       }}
       renderItem={(item) => <CelebrationCard item={item} />}
       autoAdvance={true}
       showControls={true}
     />
   </section>
   ```
