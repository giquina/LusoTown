## üöÄ New Features

### Enhanced Following System
```typescript
// New entity type for Portuguese-speaking nations

interface FollowBenefits {
  notifications: string[]  // Embassy events, cultural celebrations
  events: string[]         // National holidays, business summits
  networking: string[]     // Nationals in London, trade associations

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // Show authentication popup with context
    requireAuth(() => followEntity(entity), 'view-details', {
      type: 'follow',
      data: { entityName: entity.name, entityType: entity.type }
    })
    return false
  }
  // Database persistence with RLS policies
}
```

## üìä Database Schema

### User Following Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_following (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

  notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  followed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```
