# CONTENT QUALITY CONTROL RULES

## üö® CRITICAL RULE: NEVER ADD CONTENT WITHOUT REVIEWING EXISTING CONTENT

### **The Problem We're Solving**
- Adding new messaging without reviewing existing content leads to repetition
- Multiple overlapping value propositions confuse users
- Redundant calls-to-action reduce conversion rates
- Poor user experience from cluttered messaging

---

## üìã MANDATORY PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### **BEFORE Adding Any Content/Messaging:**

#### **1. CONTENT AUDIT REQUIRED** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Read the ENTIRE page/component where content will be added
- [ ] List all existing headlines, subheadlines, and key messages
- [ ] Identify any overlapping or similar messaging
- [ ] Note existing calls-to-action and their positioning

#### **2. REDUNDANCY CHECK** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Does this message already exist in different words?
- [ ] Are we saying the same thing multiple times?
- [ ] Do we have multiple CTAs that compete with each other?
- [ ] Is this adding value or just adding noise?

#### **3. CONTENT HIERARCHY REVIEW** ‚úÖ
- [ ] What is the PRIMARY message on this page?
- [ ] What are the SUPPORTING messages?
- [ ] Does the new content support or compete with the primary message?
- [ ] Is the flow logical and progressive?

#### **4. USER EXPERIENCE TEST** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Read the page out loud from top to bottom
- [ ] Does it flow naturally?
- [ ] Would a new user understand the value proposition quickly?
- [ ] Is there any confusion or repetition?

## üõ† IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### **Rule 1: ONE PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION PER PAGE**
- Each page should have ONE clear primary message
- All other content should support, not compete with this message
- Use hierarchy: H1 ‚Üí Primary message, H2 ‚Üí Supporting points

### **Rule 2: MAXIMUM 3 KEY MESSAGES**
- Primary value proposition
- Supporting benefit/proof point  
- Clear call-to-action
- Everything else is secondary

### **Rule 3: CONTENT CONSOLIDATION FIRST**
- Before adding new content, try to improve existing content
- Combine overlapping messages into one stronger message
- Remove weak or redundant content before adding new content

### **Rule 4: TEST CONTENT CHANGES**
- Always test content changes on localhost first
- Review the full page, not just the section being changed
- Have someone else read the page for clarity

## üö´ BANNED PRACTICES

### **NEVER DO THESE:**
- ‚ùå Add content without reading existing page content
- ‚ùå Create multiple headlines saying the same thing
- ‚ùå Add redundant calls-to-action
- ‚ùå Use multiple competing value propositions
- ‚ùå Add content "just because it sounds good"

### **RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:**
- Multiple versions of "join now" or similar CTAs
- Similar messages with slightly different wording
- More than one primary headline/value prop
- Repetitive benefit statements
- Overlapping calls-to-action

---

## üìù CONTENT REVIEW PROCESS

### **Step 1: Current State Analysis**
1. Screenshot the current page
2. List all existing messages/CTAs
3. Identify the content hierarchy
4. Note any existing problems

### **Step 2: Content Gap Analysis**  
1. What is the page trying to achieve?
2. What message is missing or weak?
3. What can be improved rather than added?
4. What should be removed?

### **Step 3: Implementation Plan**
1. Remove/consolidate redundant content FIRST
2. Strengthen existing weak content
3. Only then add new content if truly needed
4. Test the complete page flow

### **Step 4: Post-Implementation Review**
1. Read the entire page from user perspective
2. Check for flow and clarity
3. Verify no redundancy was created
4. Test on mobile and desktop
