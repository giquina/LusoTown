## 🔗 Implementation References

### **AGENTS.MD Integration**
This file references and tracks the **advisory agents** defined in `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
Advisory Agents (Documentation Framework):
├── instruction-compliance-advisor → Guides implementation decisions
├── strategic-decision-advisor → Feature prioritization framework  
├── qa-mentor-advisor → Quality standards reference
├── performance-coach-advisor → Performance optimization guidelines
├── security-guardian-advisor → Security implementation standards
└── growth-analytics-advisor → Analytics implementation guidance

Executable Agents (Actual Task Runners):
├── backend-engineer → Server-side implementation
├── frontend-architect → UI/UX implementation
├── feature-builder → Component development
├── mobile-ux-specialist → Mobile optimization
├── luso-heritage-agent → Cultural content
└── general-purpose → Flexible implementation
```

### **Cross-Reference System**
```typescript
interface ImplementationReference {
  advisoryAgent: keyof AdvisoryAgents      // From AGENTS.md
  executableAgent: keyof ExecutableAgents  // For Task tool
  implementationFile: string               // This file
  codeLocation: string                     // Actual code files
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'blocked'
}

## 📈 Implementation Velocity Tracking

### **Development Speed Metrics**
```typescript
interface VelocityMetrics {
  dailyCommits: number
  featuresCompleted: number  
  linesOfCode: number
  testsCoverage: number
  performanceScore: number
  culturalAuthenticity: number
}

// Current Week Velocity
const currentVelocity: VelocityMetrics = {
