## Executive Summary

The current LusoTown platform shows a **significant transformation** from an over-engineered system to a focused Portuguese-speaking community platform.

**Primary Concern:** "Amateurish" appearance requiring elevated visual design  
**Core Strength:** Authentic Portuguese cultural integration and mobile-first approach  
**Immediate Need:** Visual hierarchy, professional spacing, and cohesive design language
