</WelcomeProvider>
```

export {
  WELCOME_POPUP_CONFIG,
  INTEREST_CATEGORIES,
  COUNTRY_ROUTING,
  // ... other welcome exports
} from './welcome-popup';
```

### 3. Translation Support

Added bilingual translations for banner interactions:
- `welcome.banner.title`, `welcome.banner.quickTour`, etc.
- Portuguese translations in both EN and PT language files

## Core Features

### 🎯 Smart Display Logic

```typescript
// Shows popup if:
- First-time visitor (no localStorage data)
- User skipped >7 days ago
- Haven't reached max display count (3)
- Haven't completed welcome flow

// Shows banner if:
- User saw popup but didn't complete
- Banner hasn't been permanently dismissed
- Welcome flow not completed
```

### 🗺️ Intelligent Routing

```typescript
// Country-based routing examples:
Portugal → /events?country=portugal
Brazil → /events?country=brazil
Angola → /events?country=angola&category=cultural

// Interest-based routing examples:
cultural_events → /events?category=cultural
business_networking → /business-directory
student_life → /universities
```

### 📊 Comprehensive Analytics

```typescript
// Tracked events:
POPUP_SHOWN, GET_STARTED_CLICKED, SKIP_CLICKED,
COUNTRY_SELECTED, INTERESTS_SELECTED, FLOW_COMPLETED,
BANNER_SHOWN, BANNER_CLICKED, BANNER_DISMISSED
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Component Usage

```typescript
import { useWelcomeFlow } from '@/hooks/useWelcomeFlow';

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    isNewUser,
    hasCompletedWelcome,
    startWelcome,
    navigateToRecommended,
    getPersonalizedGreeting
  } = useWelcomeFlow();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{getPersonalizedGreeting()}</h1>
      {isNewUser && !hasCompletedWelcome && (
        <button onClick={startWelcome}>
          Get Started
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Personalization

  const { preferences } = useWelcome();
  
  // Show content based on user country/interests
