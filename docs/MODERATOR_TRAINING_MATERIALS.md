When handling harassment reports:
"Thank you for reporting this concerning behavior. We take all reports seriously and have begun investigating immediately. We've taken initial steps to protect you, including [specific actions].

**Case Study Examples:**
```
CASE STUDY 1: Health Discussion Boundaries
Situation: A user posts about struggling with eating disorders, including specific numbers and behaviors that could be triggering.

Policy Considerations:
• Supportive health discussions are encouraged
• Triggering content should be managed carefully
• User intent appears supportive, not harmful
• Community wellbeing must be balanced

Decision Framework:
1. Assess intent: Seeking support vs. promoting harmful behavior
2. Evaluate impact: Potential harm to vulnerable community members
3. Consider alternatives: Content warning, private support, resource referral
4. Choose intervention: Gentle guidance rather than removal

Appropriate Response:
"Thank you for sharing your experience. To support all community members, including those who might be triggered by specific details, could you edit your post to focus on feelings and recovery resources rather than specific behaviors/numbers? I'm also connecting you with professional support resources via private message."

CASE STUDY 2: Boundary-Setting vs. Discrimination
Situation: A user posts "I only want to connect with women who don't have children" in a friendship-seeking post.

Policy Considerations:
• Platform serves childfree women specifically
• Personal boundary-setting is allowed
• Exclusionary language concerns
• Community inclusivity values

Decision Framework:
1. Context: Platform purpose and user demographics
2. Intent: Personal preference vs. discriminatory judgment
3. Language: How the boundary is expressed
4. Impact: Community division vs. connection facilitation

Appropriate Response:
No action needed - this aligns with platform purpose and is expressed as personal preference rather than judgment of others.

CASE STUDY 3: Cultural Sensitivity in Moderation
Situation: A discussion about cultural traditions around women's roles becomes heated, with accusations of "internalized misogyny" and "cultural imperialism."

Policy Considerations:
• Respectful cultural discussion is valuable
• Personal attacks are not allowed
• Cultural competence in moderation required
• Multiple perspectives need respect

Decision Framework:
1. Separate cultural discussion from personal attacks
2. Address behavior, not cultural viewpoints
3. Facilitate respectful dialogue
4. Provide education about community guidelines

Appropriate Response:
Remove personal attack language while preserving cultural discussion, provide guidelines reminder about respectful disagreement, offer to facilitate continued discussion with ground rules.
