# LusoTown Mandatory Subscription System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive mandatory yearly subscription system for LusoTown with all the requested requirements:

### 1. **Mandatory Subscription for All Users**
- ✅ All users must pay £25/year subscription to access login and basic features
- ✅ Login page blocks access unless subscription is paid (`/login` wrapped with `SubscriptionGate`)
- ✅ Signup page requires subscription payment before account creation (`/signup` wrapped with `SubscriptionGate`)
- ✅ Clear messaging that subscription is required for platform access
- ✅ Demo user bypass for testing (`demo@lusotown.com` / `LusoTown2025!`)

### 2. **Transport Booking Subscription Requirement**
- ✅ Users must have active yearly subscription to make transport/chauffeur bookings
- ✅ Chauffeur booking forms blocked unless subscription is active
- ✅ Subscription required modal shown on transport pages for non-subscribers
- ✅ Integrated subscription check into booking flow

### 3. **Complete Implementation Details**
- ✅ Database schema with subscription tables (migration file created)
- ✅ Stripe payment integration with webhooks
- ✅ 7-day trial period for new users
- ✅ Subscription management pages (`/subscription`, `/subscription/success`, `/subscription/cancelled`)
- ✅ Real-time subscription status updates via webhooks
- ✅ Bilingual support (English/Portuguese)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

## 🎯 How the System Works

### 1. **User Registration Flow:**
1. User visits `/signup`
2. If not subscribed → sees subscription gate with £25/year pricing
3. User clicks "Subscribe" → redirected to Stripe checkout
4. After successful payment → redirected to `/subscription/success`
5. Webhook updates subscription status in database
6. User can now access platform features

### 2. **Login Flow:**
1. User visits `/login`
2. If not subscribed → sees subscription gate
3. Must complete subscription before accessing login form
4. Demo users (`demo@lusotown.com`) bypass requirement

### 3. **Transport Booking Flow:**
1. User tries to book chauffeur service
2. System checks subscription status via `useSubscription` hook
3. If not subscribed → shows modal with subscription requirement
4. User redirected to `/subscription` page to complete payment

### 4. **Trial System:**
- New users automatically get 7-day trial
- Trial allows full platform access
- After trial expires → subscription required
- One trial per user lifetime

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies (✅ Already Done)
```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-js stripe
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
Create `.env.local` file:
```env
# Supabase (your existing config)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Stripe Configuration (ADD THESE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Database Migration
Execute the SQL in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- Copy and run the contents of:
-- /supabase/migrations/20250816_002_subscription_system.sql
```

### 4. Stripe Configuration
1. Create Stripe account (test mode)
2. Get API keys from Stripe dashboard
3. Set up webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook/stripe`
4. Enable these webhook events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

## 🧪 Testing

### Demo Mode (✅ Working):
- Email: `demo@lusotown.com`
- Password: `LusoTown2025!`
- Demo users bypass all subscription requirements

### Test with Stripe:
- Use test credit card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Any future expiry date
- Any 3-digit CVC

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all subscription tables
- ✅ Server-side subscription status validation
- ✅ Stripe webhook signature verification
- ✅ User isolation (users only see their own data)
- ✅ Demo user protection

## 💡 Key Features

### Subscription Gates:
- **Login Gate:** Blocks login form, shows benefits, clear £25/year pricing

```
