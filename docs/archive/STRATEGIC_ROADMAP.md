The platform should become so embedded in Portuguese-speaking community life that members cannot imagine organizing events, finding services, or maintaining connections without it.

When gentrification displaces Portuguese families from Lambeth, LusoTown maintains their community connections and helps them rebuild Portuguese cultural hubs in new areas across London.
