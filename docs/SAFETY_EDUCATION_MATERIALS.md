Building genuine connections while staying safe:

SHARING INFORMATION:
🟢 Safe to share early:

• Professional industry (not specific company)
• General area you live (city, not address)

🟡 Share with caution after getting to know them:

• Specific neighborhood
• Social media profiles

🔴 Never share:
