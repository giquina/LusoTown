## Common Development Tasks

### Adding Portuguese Community Features

3. Include multilingual considerations (English/Portuguese)
4. Test with Portuguese community user stories

### Modifying Design System
1. Edit values in `web-app/tailwind.config.js`
2. Maintain Portuguese-inspired color palette
3. Test on multiple screen sizes
4. Commit changes with descriptive message

### Debugging Common Issues
- **Build errors:** Check for missing dependencies with `npm install`
- **Type errors:** Run `npx tsc --noEmit` for type checking

- **Static Export:** App is configured for static export - avoid server-side features
- **TypeScript:** All new components should be TypeScript with proper interfaces
- **Design System:** Use Tailwind classes that match Portuguese-inspired color scheme
- **Portuguese Focus:** Design components with Portuguese community in mind
