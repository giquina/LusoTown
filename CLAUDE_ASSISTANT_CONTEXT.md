## 👩‍💻 **User Profile (For Context)**
- **Experience Level:** Beginner developer
- **Learning Style:** Step-by-step with explanations
- **Preferences:** 
  - Clear instructions and analogies
  - Code explanations (what AND why)
  - Visual feedback and confirmation
  - Multiple small steps vs large changes

## 🎨 **App Concept**
Building a **premium community app for 30+ single & childfree women** with:
- Safe onboarding with selfie verification
- 30+ interest-based groups (hiking, theater, book clubs)

- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- **Payments:** Stripe API
- **Admin:** React.js web dashboard
- **Development:** GitHub + Codespaces for cloud sync

## 📋 **Development Approach**
1. **Always explain what code does AND why**
2. **Break features into small, testable steps**
3. **Provide complete, working code examples**
4. **Test frequently with visual confirmation**
5. **Keep file organization clean and logical**

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**
1. Complete email validation step (Step 3)
2. Add profile picture upload (Step 4)
3. Implement camera selfie verification (Step 5)
4. Create interest tag selection (Step 6)
5. Build welcome screen (Step 7)

## 🚨 **Important Notes**
- User works on both local Windows machine AND GitHub Codespaces
- All changes must sync between environments
- Prioritize learning and understanding over speed
- Celebrate small wins and provide encouragement
- Always test on real device when possible

## 📞 **When User Needs Help**
- Ask for screenshots of errors
- Request specific error messages
- Check file structure and current directory
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Test basic functionality before advanced features
